# YOLO Mode Launch Instructions

## Quick Start Command
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## Launch Prompt
Once in YOLO mode, use this prompt:

```
Build the complete CX Futurist AI system as specified in CLAUDE.md and PROJECT_PLAN.md. 

Start with:
1. Complete the project structure setup
2. Create all configuration files (.env.example, docker-compose.yml, etc.)
3. Implement the base infrastructure (base classes, WebSocket server, API structure)
4. Build the frontend foundation with Next.js
5. Create all 6 AI agents with real-time streaming capabilities
6. Implement the MCP servers for data ingestion
7. Set up the vector database with semantic search
8. Build all frontend visualization components
9. Create the orchestration layer with CrewAI
10. Implement example analyses and test scenarios

Focus on making the frontend visualization spectacular - I want to see:
- Agents thinking and collaborating in real-time
- Knowledge connections forming in the 3D graph
- Trends flowing from weak signals to strong insights
- Scenarios branching and evolving
- Confidence meters and source tracking

Make it production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and documentation.
```

## What YOLO Mode Will Do

### Automated Actions
- Create 100+ files across the project
- Set up complete folder structure
- Install dependencies
- Configure all services
- Build the entire frontend
- Implement all agents
- Create test scenarios
- Generate documentation

### Key Focus Areas
1. **Agent Intelligence** - Sophisticated analysis capabilities
2. **Real-time Streaming** - WebSocket integration throughout
3. **Visual Excellence** - Stunning, informative visualizations
4. **Production Quality** - Error handling, logging, monitoring

### Expected Outcome
A fully functional CX Futurist AI system with:
- Working multi-agent analysis
- Beautiful real-time dashboard
- Semantic knowledge repository
- Example trend analyses
- Complete documentation

## Time Estimate
With YOLO mode running continuously: 4-6 hours for complete implementation

## Post-Build Steps
After YOLO mode completes:
1. Review the generated code
2. Add your API keys to .env
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Access the dashboard at http://localhost:3000
5. Start analyzing the future of CX!

## Remember
YOLO mode will work autonomously - let it run without interruption for best results. The system will be complex but well-organized, with clear documentation throughout.
